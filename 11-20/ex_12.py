#Prompting People
# When you type input you type (), the parenthesis characters
# This is similar to when you used them to do a format with extra variables
# as in f"{x} {y}". For input you can also put in a prompt to show a person
# so they know a type. Put a String that you ant for the prompt inside the ()
# so that it looks like this:
#    y = input("Name?")

# This prompts the user with "Name?" and puts the result into the variable y.

age = input("How old are you?")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
