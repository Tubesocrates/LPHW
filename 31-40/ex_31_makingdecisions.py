#       Exercise 31
#       Making Decisions

#
# In the first half of this book you mostly just printed out things called
# functions, but everything was basically in a straight line. Your scripts ran
# starting at the top and went to the bottom where they ended. If you made a
# function, you could run that function later, but it still didnâ€™t have the kind of
# branching you need to really make decisions. Now that you have if, else,
# and elif you can start to make scripts that decide things.
# In the last script you wrote out a simple set of tests asking some questions. In
# this script you will ask the user questions and make decisions based on their
# answers. Write this script, and then play with it quite a lot to figure it out.
