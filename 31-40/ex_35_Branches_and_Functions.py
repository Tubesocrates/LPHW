# Study Drills
# 1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.
    # no
# 2. Fix all of your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.
# did
# 3. Write comments for the functions you do not understand.
# 4. Add more to the game. What can you do to both simplify and expand it?
# 5. The gold_room has a weird way of getting you to type a number. What are
# all the bugs in this way of doing it? Can you make it better than what Iâ€™ve
# written? Look at how int() works for clues.
